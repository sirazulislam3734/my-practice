<p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, <strong>proposed</strong> and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN <em>researchers to use and share documents</em>. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an <small>Internet-based hypertext system</small>.</p>

<p> Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.</p>
